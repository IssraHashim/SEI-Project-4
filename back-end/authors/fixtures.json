    "biography": "Her childhood, growing up as the second of four sisters at the lyrically named Orchard House, would later form the basis of her most famous novel, Little Women. Although Alcott had written stories, poems and plays from childhood and published work from her early twenties – including powerful accounts of her time as a Civil War nurse - it was Little Women that made her name. Written after her publisher requested a ‘girl’s story’, Little Women tells the story of the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Like her self-modelled heroine Jo, Alcott was headstrong, determined and an inveterate t",

    "biography": "Oscar Wilde was an Irish author and the most popular playwright in 1890s London. He studied the Classics at Dublin and Oxford before moving to London. He wrote his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, in 1890 but his reputation arose from the success of his plays.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Wilde brought a case of libel against the Marquess of Queensberry after the latter called him a sodomite. During the trial, evidence appeared which led to Wilde's eventual arrest for 'gross indecency with other men.' He was imprisoned to two years hard labour and left for France upon his release. He died in Paris at the age of 46.",

    "biography": "Dickens was born in Portsmouth in 1812, the second of eight children, but the family moved to London two years later. When Charles was twelve his father was imprisoned in the Marshalsea debtor’s prison, a momentous event in the young Dickens’ life which forced him out of school and into a ‘blacking’ factory to help support his impecunious family. Although this state-of-affairs lasted only a few months, the first-hand experience of poverty shaped much of Dickens’ literary output and contributed to him becoming one of the fiercest critics of social deprivation of the Victorian age. Upon leaving school at fifteen, Dickens found work as a court reporter and began to contribute short stories and essays to periodicals. Assuming the pseudonym of Boz, he published his first collection, Sketches by Boz, in 1836. The following year saw the appearance of The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club in monthly instalments.",

He is best known for writing historical novels such as The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers. He was one of the earliest authors to fully use the possibilities provided by the serial novel that kept readers gripped as the story unfolded.\r\n\r\nHe was hugely successful in his lifetime but rarely held on to his money as he spent it on his expensive lifestyle and women. One recent historian suspects Dumas of having up to forty mistresses. He created over 250 books with the help of an army of assistants, most noticeably the historian Auguste Maquet who would compose the plots and Dumas would elaborate, writing the details, dialogue and final chapters.\r\n\r\nDumas died of a stroke on 5th December 1870 at Puys, near Dieppe leaving behind at least four children from his numerous liaisons.",

Published in 1969 the novel, and Atwood herself, were quickly adopted as icons of the feminist movement but Atwood has always denied such over labelling of her work, saying, \"novels are something else. They aren't just political messages… it's not a matter of men against women.\"",

He is the author of the best-selling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), which emphasises the themes of his work on wealth concentrations and distribution over the past 250 years. The book argues that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth, and that this will cause wealth inequality to increase in the future.",
